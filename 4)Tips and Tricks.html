      <h1>First off here's how to become a better Rocket League player: </h1>
      <p class="paragraph-tips"><strong>Use the camera settings!</strong>
        <br>I know what you’re thinking. You came in expecting advice on how to score stylishly and you’ve found us
        talking
        about camera settings?<br> I’ll concede this isn’t the most exciting tip but hear us out, camera settings are
        crucial.<br> Rocket League’s default settings showcase the action ahead decently, but should you wish, the game
        lets
        you individually tweak several key aspects, like field of view or distance.<br>

        This tip isn’t here to tell you exactly what this should be changed too. You might find other players have
        listed their own settings online, which is perfectly fine, but everyone has personal preferences.<br> If you’re
        finding it difficult to land those specific shots or you’d like to see more of the arena, consider giving these
        a tweak.<br> This could be the difference in securing that winning shot and losing the match.<br>

        <strong>Rotate between positions</strong><br>
        Rotations are the key to any successful team coordination with Rocket League. If you’re looking to get serious
        in 3v3s, I’d suggest finding two friends willing to play, mainly because you’ll have a much easier time
        convincing them to follow a plan than random online players.<br> That’s because rotations involve changing
        positions
        on the field to better assist your teammates, doing what benefits them instead of chasing personal glory.<br>

        Assuming you’ve not chosen 1v1 mode, you can’t always be the person taking shots and intercepting your
        opponent’s strikes.<br> Talk with your squad, discuss who’s lining up the pass and who’s taking that shot, maybe
        hang back slightly if you know the ball’s not going in. You can’t win a team game by acting alone, make sure
        they know what you’re doing.<br>

        <strong>Don’t go ball chasing</strong><br>
        This tip is essentially an extension on my rotation advice and for good reason, ball chasers are a common
        problem in 2v2 and 3v3 matches.<br> In a game where you’re aiming to score as many goals as possible, it’s
        naturally
        tempting to rush in for that hit, and we’ve all made this mistake when starting out as rookies. However, this
        can ultimately lose you the game and some prime scoring opportunities.<br>

        Why? It can put you out of position.<br> When a teammate’s already dribbling up the side, they don’t need you
        gunning it right behind them, ready to strike if something goes wrong or to take the shot for them. If there’s
        no one in the middle, a good pass from said teammate suddenly amounts to nothing. <br>By then, you’ve missed a
        goal
        scoring opportunity and frustrated teammates in one go. Just remember that you don’t need to take every
        shot.<br>

        <strong>Use boost carefully</strong><br>
        Boosting is an essential part of any Rocket League strategy. Letting you store up to 100 boost units, players
        demolish an opponent’s car, take aerial shots, or simply move across the field at pace. Unfortunately, this gets
        quickly consumed and while each stadium has no end of boost pads, I’d recommend saving them until an appropriate
        time. After all, how many assists have we failed to convert because we couldn’t reach the ball in time?<br>

        Once you’ve hit maximum speed, further boosts are unnecessary and while it’s a sensible plan to keep your tank
        replenished, you don’t necessarily need to go out of your way collecting them.<br> You’ll find smaller ones
        littered
        around an arena which restore 12 units, alongside 6 larger orbs that restore 100 units, though these take much
        longer to respawn.<br> Remember that your teammates need a boost too, they’ll (maybe) thank you later.<br>

        <strong>Defend From the Back Post</strong><br>
        Rocket League doesn’t enforce set positions like in football/soccer but when it comes to 2v2s or 3v3 matches,
        sometimes players hang back to act as a goalkeeper.<br> If you’re winning a match and are taking a cautious
        approach, there’s no shame in acting defensively, of course, but this isn’t the best strategy. Ideally, you’ll
        want to place your car by the back post, the one furthest from whatever side of the goal the ball’s at.<br>

        That’s because you’ll have a better reaction window to intercept an aerial shot. If you’re positioned by the
        near post, there’s a much better chance your opponent can shoot this straight over your head.<br> If there’s a
        teammate close to said opponent, that frees them up to attempt a direct tackle without compromising defence.<br>
        Ultimately, it’s a better way to counter side shots than waiting in the middle.<br>

      <h1>Finally, suck at CS:GO? Not for much longer: </h1>
      <p class="paragraph-csgo"><strong>1. Start with the Core Weapons</strong>

        There are a lot of guns in CS:GO. Some of them look very impressive, and many beginners will want to introduce
        them to the game. For example, they purchase Desert Eagle or AWP and can’t understand how such great weapons
        don’t deliver nice headshots.
        It would be much better to start your practice with more effective in-game firearms. They are:<br>
        • Pistols: Tec-9 (T), Five-SeveN (CT), P250 (both teams)<br>
        • Riffles: AK-47 (T) and M4A4/M4A1-S (CT)<br>
        Don’t rush to learn about other guns unless you can use the above mentioned ones on a decent level - this is how
        to play CS GO and get victories. The rifles are especially effective and most pro players take them to matches
        as well.<br>

        <strong>2. Practice Accurate Shooting</strong><br>
        There are lots of things happening in CS:GO matches, so you might have no time to stay calm and practice aiming
        and shooting. But it is a worthy training that will pay off nicely.
        You have three options:<br>
        • Start the game on community-created maps specially dedicated to aiming. Just search for aim training on the
        Steam Workshop and try out any map you find interesting. Make this CS GO training your regular practice.<br>
        • Play with bots and try to concentrate only on shooting. Keep the other important aspects aside for a
        while.<br>
        • Play the Deathmatch mode - it’s a very good practice of fast shooting.<br>

        <strong>3. Use Burst Fire</strong><br>
        It’s quite hard to deliver nice headshots with a single shot - to do this you need to be very precise in timing,
        movements, and accuracy. It’s not easy to be accurate while spraying bullets (when you keep the left mouse
        button pressed) - you should learn CS:GO spray patterns and recoil compensation to figure out how the bullet
        streams behave.<br>
        Another shooting mode is much more convenient for beginners - burst fire. You shoot a few bullets, so your gun
        remains accurate. And you don’t need to rely on the deadly power of one shoot because other bullets will deal
        additional damage.<br>
        Stay still while shooting. In CS:GO, you can’t shoot accurately while moving. Learn how to freeze for a moment
        to make the burst and then continue moving around the map. It’s a very good piece of advice for those who wonder
        how to get good at CSGO.<br> To practice in-game movements, you can try out other fun bits of entertainment such
        as
        CS:GO surfing.<br>

        <strong>4. Check Your Bullets and Reload</strong><br>
        You should always have enough ammo in the magazine to be ready for killing virtual opponents. But reloading
        takes time and this means you remain vulnerable.<br>
        It would be wise to wait for proper moments to reload CS:GO guns. You should feel safe for this and should only
        do it when really in a need of more bullets.<br>

        <strong>5. Listen to the Sounds</strong><br>
        It’s hard not to make noises in the virtual world of CS:GO, but still, you should be very careful with stomping
        and banging around.<br> Opponents will be able to distinguish your position and organize an unexpected attack.
        At the same time, you should use this feature for the benefits of your team. Always play with a headset to hear
        everything properly.<br> Make decisions on the base of those sounds. This simple but very effective advice will
        help
        you to rank up in CS:GO fast.
