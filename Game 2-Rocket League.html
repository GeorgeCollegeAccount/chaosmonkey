      <h1></h1>
      <p class="paragraph-rocket"><br>Described as "soccer, but with rocket-powered cars", Rocket League has up to eight
        players assigned to each of the two teams, using rocket-powered vehicles to hit a ball into their opponent's
        goal and score points over the course of a match.<br> The game includes single-player and multiplayer modes that
        can be played both locally and online, including cross-platform play between all versions.<br> Later updates for
        the game enabled the ability to modify core rules and added new game modes, including ones based on ice hockey
        and basketball.</p>
